Okay, here is a detailed comparison of major AI agent frameworks. AI agent frameworks provide the structure, tools, and components necessary to build applications where Large Language Models (LLMs) don't just generate text, but actively plan, reason, use tools, and interact with their environment to achieve complex goals.

Here's a comparison of some prominent frameworks:

**1. LangChain**

* **Core Concept:** A highly versatile and popular framework focused on **composability**. It provides modular building blocks (LLMs, Prompts, Memory, Indexes, Chains, Agents, Tools) that developers can "chain" together to create sophisticated LLM applications, including agents.
